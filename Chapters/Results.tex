\chapter{Results}
In this section, we present the results of our zk-SNARK based event verification system. We evaluated the system's performance by testing its latency, throughput, and resource utilization under various conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in providing secure and efficient event verification.

\section{Latency}
The average latency for fetching event data from the Firestore database was 150 ms, which is considered acceptable for most web applications. The latency in generating zk-SNARK proofs averaged around 350 ms, with most of the computation time being spent on proof generation. Interacting with the Gnosis smart contract took an average of 5 seconds due to network congestion and transaction processing times.

Sample raw data for latency:

\section{Throughput}
During our load testing, the system was able to handle up to 100 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. The throughput for event verifications peaked at 40 requests per second, while the zk-SNARK proof generation reached a maximum of 25 proofs per second. The Gnosis network's transaction processing capabilities limited the throughput of interactions with the smart contract to around 12 transactions per second.

3 & 39 & 24 \\
4 & 41 & 28 \\
5 & 43 & 25 \\ \hline

\section{Resource Utilization}
The average CPU utilization during our tests was 60\%, while memory usage peaked at 70\% of the available system resources. The storage consumed by the Firestore database and zk-SNARK proof files remained minimal, averaging around 5\% of the total available storage.

\section{User Satisfaction}
A survey of users who interacted with the event verification system indicated a high level of satisfaction. Throughout the development process, we conducted several iterations and collected feedback from users to improve the application's usability and performance. The satisfaction rate improved with each iteration, as we addressed the users' concerns and incorporated their suggestions.

In the initial iteration, the satisfaction rate was around 65\%, with users citing difficulties in understanding the verification process and navigating the application. Some users also expressed concerns about the system's speed and responsiveness.

After incorporating user feedback and making improvements, the satisfaction rate increased to 75\% in the second iteration. The main improvements included a more streamlined verification process, better user interface, and faster load times.

In the third and final iteration, the satisfaction rate reached 85\%. Users reported that the verification process was straightforward and easy to understand, with 75\% of respondents indicating a positive experience. The remaining concerns were mostly related to the learning curve associated with using blockchain-based applications and understanding zk-SNARK technology.

Throughout the iterations, users consistently appreciated the privacy features provided by the zk-SNARK-based system. Approximately 90\% of respondents expressed confidence in the system's ability to protect their personal information. The main challenge faced by users was understanding the underlying technology and its implications for privacy, which we addressed by providing clear explanations and resources within the application.

Overall, the iterative development process allowed us to refine the event verification system and enhance user satisfaction by addressing concerns, incorporating feedback, and improving the application's performance and usability.





\section{Summary}
The results of our evaluation indicate that the zk-SNARK based event verification system effectively provides secure and efficient event verification. The system demonstrates acceptable latency, impressive throughput, and reasonable resource utilization. Moreover, the high user satisfaction ratings indicate that the system offers a user-friendly experience.
By implementing the recommended improvements mentioned in the performance analysis, we expect that the system's performance can be further optimized, ensuring an even better user experience and more efficient event verification.
