\chapter{Conclusion}
The zk-SNARK-based event verification system presented in this study demonstrates the feasibility of applying advanced cryptographic techniques to real-world scenarios. The current state of the art provides a foundation for creating secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving solutions for various applications.

However, there are still some limitations when it comes to handling large-scale events with a significant number of guests requiring zero-knowledge verification. As the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is expected that these challenges will be addressed, making zk-SNARKs more practical for an even broader range of applications.

The rapid growth of research in this area and the increasing interest from companies and developers have led to the development of new libraries and tools, further expanding the potential use cases of zk-SNARKs. This momentum is expected to continue, fostering innovation and driving the widespread adoption of zero-knowledge-proof technologies.

In conclusion, the zk-SNARK-based event verification system showcases the potential of zero-knowledge proofs in real-world applications. As the technology matures, it is anticipated that it will revolutionise the way we approach privacy and security in various domains, opening up new possibilities for decentralised and privacy-preserving solutions.
